Password Complexity Checker

This Python script evaluates the strength of a password based on common security criteria. It checks whether a password meets specific requirements to be considered strong.

How It Works:

The script checks the password against the following criteria:

Minimum Length: The password must be at least 8 characters long.

Uppercase Letters: The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.

Lowercase Letters: The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.

Digits: The password must include at least one numeric digit.

Special Characters: The password must have at least one special character from the set !@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>.

Usage:

Run the script and input a password when prompted.

The script will analyze the password and output feedback, indicating either that the password is strong or specifying which criteria are not met.

This tool is a basic utility to help users create more secure passwords by adhering to these common password strength guidelines.
